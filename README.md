I’m @AugustusGreenwood, current researcher at Washington University in St. Louis in the Setton Lab. 
I’m interested in things with relationship to science, have experience with programming hardware and working with molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations.
I’m currently learning Rust and C, trying to program a stepper motor driver to move a stage to cyclically compress biological samples
