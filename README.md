- 👋 Hi, I’m @AugustusGreenwood
- 👀 I’m interested in things with relationship to science, have experience with programming hardware and working with molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and C, trying to program a stepper motor driver to move a stage to cyclically compress biological samples
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything, but especially things related to physics computation
